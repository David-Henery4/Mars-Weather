 "Mars weather is an web app that allows us to check to most up to date weather on mars"

This is a minimalist style mars weather web app that shows users the latest weather data, coming from the mars curiosity rover on mars.

The design is very flexable and has a video background of mars rotating. It also works on all screen sizes from mobile to desktop.

Mars Weather app also includes a **fahrenheit to celsius switch** so users can view the temperature any way they want.

The technologies used to develop this project were **HTML**, **CSS** & **Javascript**. Aswell as using **git** for verion control on the project. **Parcel** was used as the bundler in order to create the production ready version of this app.

### APIs used

I only needed one API for this project. The data was provided by

Originally i tried to use the Nasa API which recieves data from their InSight rover but that data was unavailable and has been so for a while.
